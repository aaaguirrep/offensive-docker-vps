## Example(s)

### Simple

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - fail2ban
```

### Enable sshd filter (with non-default settings)

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - fail2ban
  vars:
    fail2ban_services:
      # In older versions of Fail2Ban this is called ssh
      - name: sshd
        port: 2222
        maxretry: 5
        bantime: -1
```

### Add custom filters (from outside the role)

```yaml
---
- hosts: all
  roles:
    - fail2ban
  vars:
    fail2ban_filterd_path: ../../../files/fail2ban/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/
    fail2ban_services:
      - name: apache-wordpress-logins
        port: http,https
        filter: apache-wordpress-logins
        logpath: /var/log/apache2/access.log
        maxretry: 5
        findtime: 120
```
